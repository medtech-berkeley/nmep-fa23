Given the following list of data points: [12, 15, 18, 21, 24], create a numpy array and calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of these values. Store the results in separate variables.

Perform matrix multiplication on two numpy arrays: A (2x3 matrix) and B (3x2 matrix). Store the result in a variable called result_matrix.

Generate two random numpy arrays, data1 and data2, each with 100 samples.
Conduct a t-test to compare the means of data1 and data2.
Print the p-value from the t-test.

1. Create 4 Lists with 5 elements in each:
Name 
Age 
Gender
Score

2. Create a dictionary from these fours lists
    Create a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary with columns: 'Name', 'Age', 'Gender', 'Score'.

3. Calculate the mean age and the maximum score in the DataFrame.
4. Plot a bar chart showing the count of each gender.

Load a dataset (students.csv) into a pandas DataFrame.
Conduct a hypothesis test to compare a numerical variable between two or more groups in the dataset.
Use matplotlib to create appropriate visualizations (e.g., box plot, histogram) to represent the data.
Provide a summary of the hypothesis test results and your visualizations, explaining any insights gained from the analysis.
